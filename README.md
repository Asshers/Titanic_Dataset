# Titanic_Dataset
KNN and SVM algorithms with Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation to predict passenger survival in the Titanic dataset.

In this project, a powerful K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms are leveraged to predict passenger survival in the Titanic dataset. 
By employing Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation, we ensure that the data is divided into folds while maintaining the same distribution of survival and non-survival instances in each fold. 
This approach helps us evaluate the models' performance consistently across various subsets of the data. 
The KNN algorithm uses the similarity of neighboring data points to make predictions, while SVM algorithm aims to find an optimal hyperplane to classify the data. 
By leveraging the benefits of both models, we strive to achieve accurate predictions of passenger survival. The results are evaluated using relevant metrics to assess the effectiveness of the models in handling the Titanic dataset.
